## Usage

### Adding People to the System

Before running the attendance system, you need to add people to the face database:

#### Method 1: Add Photos to faces/ Directory

1. Take a clear photo of each person (good lighting, facing camera)
2. Save the photo as `firstname_lastname.jpg` in the `faces/` directory
3. The filename becomes the person's name in the system

Example:
```bash
faces/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ john_doe.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jane_smith.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alice_johnson.jpg
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bob_wilson.jpg
```

#### Method 2: Command Line Addition

```bash
python main.py --add-person path/to/photo.jpg "Person Name"
```

#### Method 3: Interactive Addition

1. Run the main system: `python main.py`
2. Press 'a' during operation
3. Follow the prompts to add person photos

### Running the Attendance System

You can run the attendance system in two ways:

#### Option 1: Gradio Web Interface (Recommended)

```bash
python Gradio_interface.py
```

This launches a user-friendly web interface with:
- **üë§ Add Person to Database Tab**: 
  - Upload photos directly through browser
  - Add people to the face recognition database
  - Real-time database status updates
  - Automatic face detection validation
- **üìπ Live Attendance View Tab**: 
  - Start/Stop webcam controls
  - Real-time face recognition overlay
  - Auto-updating attendance table
  - Today's attendance summary
  - Download attendance Excel file

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Updates**: Attendance table refreshes automatically every 2 seconds
- ‚úÖ **Face Validation**: System validates uploaded images contain detectable faces
- ‚úÖ **Auto-restart Recognition**: Adding new people automatically updates the recognition pipeline
- ‚úÖ **Live Statistics**: Real-time display of today's attendance summary
- ‚úÖ **Excel Export**: One-click download of attendance data
- ‚úÖ **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile browsers

The web interface will be available at `http://localhost:7860` and will automatically open in your browser.

#### Option 2: Command Line Interface

```bash
python main.py
```

This starts the traditional CLI version with real-time attendance monitoring.

#### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Use a different camera
python main.py --camera 1

# Show attendance statistics only
python main.py --stats

# Export attendance data
python main.py --export
```

### System Controls

#### Gradio Web Interface Controls

**üë§ Add Person to Database Tab:**
- Upload image files directly through the browser (supports .jpg, .png, .jpeg)
- Enter person's full name and click "‚ûï Add to Database"
- Real-time database statistics showing total faces and unique people
- Automatic face detection validation (warns if no face detected)
- Auto-saves images to faces/ directory for future use

**üìπ Live Attendance View Tab:**
- **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Webcam** / **‚èπÔ∏è Stop Webcam** buttons for camera control
- Real-time webcam feed with face detection/recognition overlay
- Auto-updating attendance table (refreshes every 2 seconds)
- Today's attendance summary with live statistics
- **üì• Download Attendance Excel** button for instant data export
- System info overlay showing detection statistics and current time

#### CLI Controls (main.py)

While the CLI system is running:

- **'q'**: Quit the application
- **'a'**: Add new person interactively
- **'s'**: Show current statistics
- **ESC**: Also quits the application

### Understanding the Output

The system shows:
- **Green boxes**: Known people with their names and similarity scores
- **Red boxes**: Unknown faces
- **System info**: Frame count, detected faces, recognized faces, current time
- **Console logs**: Attendance logging notifications and system status

## How It Works

### 1. Face Detection (SCRFD)
- Detects faces in each video frame
- Provides bounding boxes and facial landmarks
- Optimized for real-time performance

### 2. Face Recognition (ArcFace)
- Extracts 512-dimensional face embeddings
- Uses facial landmarks for proper alignment
- Highly accurate face representation

### 3. Face Identification (FAISS)
- Stores face embeddings in a searchable vector database
- Performs fast similarity search using cosine distance
- Enables real-time face matching

### 4. Attendance Logging
- Records name, date, time, and similarity score
- Prevents duplicate entries within the same day (configurable)
- Saves data to Excel file (`attendance.xlsx`)

## Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize the system:

```python
# Detection thresholds
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.5    # Face detection confidence
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.4    # Face recognition similarity
DUPLICATE_THRESHOLD_HOURS = 8 # Hours before re-logging same person

# Camera settings  
CAMERA_INDEX = 0              # Which camera to use

# File paths
ATTENDANCE_FILE = "attendance.xlsx"  # Output file name
```

## Attendance Data

The system creates an Excel file (`attendance.xlsx`) with columns:
- **Name**: Person's name
- **Date**: Date of attendance  
- **Time**: Time of attendance
- **Similarity_Score**: Face recognition confidence (0-1)

### Duplicate Prevention

The system prevents duplicate attendance logging for the same person within a configurable time window (default: 8 hours). This prevents multiple logs if someone passes by the camera multiple times.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Cannot open camera"**
   - Check if your camera is being used by another application
   - Try different camera indices (0, 1, 2, etc.)
   - Ensure camera permissions are granted
   - In Gradio interface: Close any other camera applications and restart

2. **"Failed to load model weights"**
   - Verify model files are in the `weights/` directory
   - Check file names match exactly: `det_10g.onnx` and `w600k_r50.onnx`
   - Ensure files downloaded completely

3. **"No face detected in image"** (especially when adding people via Gradio)
   - Use clear, well-lit photos
   - Ensure face is clearly visible and not too small
   - Face should be front-facing and unobstructed
   - Try different photos of the same person
   - The Gradio interface will show this error message if no face is found

4. **Poor recognition accuracy**
   - Adjust `SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` in config.py
   - Use higher quality reference photos
   - Ensure good lighting during live operation

5. **Gradio interface issues**
   - **Browser not opening automatically**: Navigate manually to `http://localhost:7860`
   - **Interface not loading**: Check if port 7860 is already in use
   - **Webcam not starting**: Ensure no other applications are using the camera
   - **Attendance table not updating**: Refresh the page or restart the interface

### Performance Tips

1. **CPU Usage**: The system runs on CPU only. For better performance:
   - Close unnecessary applications
   - Use smaller camera resolution
   - Increase `DUPLICATE_THRESHOLD_HOURS` to reduce logging frequency

2. **Accuracy**: For better recognition:
   - Use multiple photos per person
   - Ensure good lighting in reference photos
   - Keep camera at appropriate distance (2-6 feet)
